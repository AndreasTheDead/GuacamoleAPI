# GuacamoleAPI

This module is my attemp on creating a Module to manage [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) servers via Powershell.
This module is also compatible with [Keeper Connection Manager](https://www.keepersecurity.com/connection-manager.html).

This Module is also used by Myself to learn a bit more powershell scripting and working with APIs.

## Documentation
