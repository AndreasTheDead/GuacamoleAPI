# KeeperConnectionManager API

This module is my attempt on creating a Module to manage [Keeper Connection Manager](https://www.keepersecurity.com/connection-manager.html)(KCM) servers via Powershell.
This module is also compatible with [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) but the needed Attributes may differ and usage is not as easy, as there are many parallels but for example connection attributes differ quite a bit Between KCM and Guacamole.

This Module is also used by Myself to learn a bit more PowerShell scripting and working with APIs.
